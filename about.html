        <p>
            I am a passionate freelance programmer with a strong background in web development.
            My journey in the world of coding started two years ago when I discovered my love for
            creating web applications. Since then, I have been honing my skills and
            working on a wide range of projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            I specialize in front-end and back-end development, and I'm proficient in languages like
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and more. I have a keen eye for design and enjoy creating
            visually appealing and user-friendly websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a freelancer, I am committed to delivering high-quality solutions to my clients.
            Whether it's building a responsive website, optimizing performance, or solving complex
            coding challenges, I'm always up for the task.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, contributing to
            open-source projects, or enjoying a good cup of coffee while brainstorming new ideas.
